      <h2>An interesting fact</h2>
      <p>I have 'photic sneeze reflex', which means bright lights make me sneeze. I literally can't go outside on a sunny day without sneezing.</p>

      <h2>My favourite software</h2>
      <p>The 1993 game DOOM, simply because you can get it to run on literally any computer that has a display. People make it run on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsN2JIRGHAo">calculator</a>, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLHx3vO7KJM">printer</a> and even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5NTJSfUWDE">pregnancy test</a>. The game also kicks ass so that helps too.</p>

      <h2>My experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I started learning code at the start of the year, watching video tutorials to learn the basics.</li>
        <li>I've made a handful of sites, some offering actual useful functionality but mostly just silly applications or games.</li>
        <li>I've really only used HTML, CSS and Javascript since they were the easiest to practice at my work computer.</li>
        <li>I enjoy the design process when I have a good idea, but those are hard to come by. Luckily I also enjoy the logic problem solving aspect so that usually keeps me busy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Things I've made:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://dayattherac.es/">A dumb name picker thing</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://totallynormalpoker.com/">A dumb poker game thing</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My ambitions</h2>
      <p>Get into a career that I don't hate. Apparently it's harder than it looks but I think I'm onto a winner now.</p>
